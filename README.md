## Where am I? What does "Joc d'EDA" mean?

EDA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is a subject that gets taught in the FIB (Barcelona School of Informatics), a school of the UPC (Polytechnic University of Catalonia).
Algorísmia (algorithmics) is a subject that gets taught in the FME (School of Mathematics and Statistics), also a school of the UPC.

Every semester, EDA and Algorísmia students must code an AI that plays a given game, and a competition is held between all the students. This is known as the *EDA Game (Joc d'EDA)*.
The best players of each school go on to compete in a grand final held live, and one AI gets crowned as the winner.
